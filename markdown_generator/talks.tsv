Magnetically induced current densities in molecules consisting of annelated aromatic and antiaromatic rings	Talk	URL	Magnetically induced currents (MAGIC) workshop	6.9.2016	Salerno, Italy	URL	My first oral presentation at an international meeting. It shows the preliminary results about our study on dibenzopentalene and its heterocyclic analogues with boron and nitrogen. We investigated the ring-current pathways and the aromaticity. 
Molecular properties in magnetic fields	Talk	URL	Chemistry and beer	8.11.2018	Helsinki, Finland	URLL	A short talk to introduce freshman students to the properties of molecules in magnetic fields
Properties of molecules in weak and strong magnetic fields	Talk PPT	Computational chemistry days	30.8.2019	Kuopio, Finland	URL	I sumarise the major points of my research towards my doctoral thesis. Magnetically induced current densities in molecules are discussed. Some insights into the strong magnetic field regime are given, as well as hints about the difficulties to modelling molecules in such an environment. 
Properties of molecules in weak and strong magnetic fields	Lecture	PPT	My doctoral defence	27.9.2019	Helsinki, Finland	https://www.slideshare.net/MariaDimitrova31/lectio-praecursoria-191425813	In my lectio praecursoria -- or the lecture for the defence of my doctoral thesis -- I succinctly report some of the major points of my research for general public. No scientific results are discussed but hints are given about what we are doing in our research group.
