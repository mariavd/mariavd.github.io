I am a theoretical/computational chemist who recently graduated as a Ph.D. In
the past three years I have focused on quantum chemistry calculations to
investigate the properties of molecules in weak and strong magnetic fields. My
PhD thesis can be found [here](http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-51-5401-9).

To me science is a passion which should be conveyed to others. I value the
visual representation of results and dedicated a lot of time to present the
magnetically induced currents in molecules in a clear way. It is my way of
artistic expression. A hint of the powers of scientific visualisation is the
picture below which summarises a half of my PhD thesis. For more check out my
Portfolio page.
